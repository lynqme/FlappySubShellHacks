# FlappySubShellHacks
Hello! This is the ShellHacks Project 2022!
For this project, we decided to use Flappy Bird as reference for our game. It mimicks the physics and motion of the game, only it is an underwater theme.

## What it does
Using a simple reference from the game “Flappy Bird”, we mimicked its physics to create it in an underwater theme. 
The project tasks the user to begin whenever they are ready and avoid crashing into the poles in between. 
If the player avoids them, the game continues infinitely until it crashes. However, there is a twist!
The poles do not remain stationary, they shift up and down depending on their positions. 
This makes for an interesting yet simple approach to the game!
